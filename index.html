<h2>Deterministic AI Infrastructure for Regulated Wealth Platforms</h2>

<p>
Audit-ready querying of custodian data — designed for platform, aggregator, and custodian deployment.
</p>

<p>
Kanika is building deterministic AI infrastructure that enables audit-ready access to custodian data in regulated wealth environments.
The system translates user intent into constrained, validated queries and automatically generates reproducible evidence and audit trails.
</p>

<p>
Most AI tools are probabilistic and ship with disclaimers, which makes them unsuitable for use inside compliance, operations, and exam-sensitive workflows.
Kanika is designed as a system-level compliance and query layer — not a point solution for individual firms.
</p>

<p>
Individual RIAs are used as the initial validation wedge to prove workflows in production.
Long-term scale comes from platform and custodian deployment, where a single integration reaches hundreds or thousands of downstream advisors.
</p>

<p>
Founded by a former asset manager and Chief Compliance Officer with firsthand experience through multiple SEC exams,
including an AI-focused limited-scope exam.
